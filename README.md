# DBP-Inl2
The task was to build an own API that was based on a dog daycare.
You must be able to:
- Add a dog
   Name the dog
- Remove a dog ( :< )
- Sign in
- The dog must have an owner (the owner is the one who added the dog)

Added in V2
- Pixel stylized dog daycare.
- A house where you can walk in and see your own dogs.
- A backyard where all dogs are.
